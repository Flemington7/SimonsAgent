Sentiment analysis on financial and economic information is highly relevant for businesses for several key reasons, ranging from market insights (gain valuable insights into market trends, investor confidence, and consumer behavior) to risk management (identifying potential reputational risks) to investment decisions (gauging the sentiment of stakeholders, investors, and the general public businesses can assess the potential success of various investment opportunities).\n\nBefore the technicalities of fine-tuning a large language model like Llama 3, we have to find the correct dataset to demonstrate the potentialities of fine-tuning.\n\nParticularly within the realm of finance and economic texts, annotated datasets are notably rare, with many being exclusively reserved for proprietary purposes. To address the issue of insufficient training data, scholars from the Aalto University School\nof Business introduced in 2014 a set of approximately 5000 sentences. This collection aimed to establish human-annotated benchmarks, serving as a standard for evaluating alternative modeling techniques. The involved annotators (16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets) were instructed to assess the sentences solely from the perspective of an investor, evaluating whether the news potentially holds a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the stock price.\n\nThe FinancialPhraseBank dataset is a comprehensive collection that captures the sentiments of financial news headlines from the viewpoint of a retail investor. Comprising two key columns, namely \"Sentiment\" and \"News Headline,\" the dataset effectively classifies sentiments as either negative, neutral, or positive. This structured dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding the complex dynamics of sentiment in the domain of financial news. It has been used in various studies and research initiatives, since its inception in the work by Malo, P., Sinha, A., Korhonen, P., Wallenius, J., and Takala, P.  \"Good debt or bad debt: Detecting semantic orientations in economic texts.\", published in the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology in 2014.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a first step, we install the specific libraries necessary to make this example work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* accelerate is a distributed training library for PyTorch by HuggingFace. It allows you to train your models on multiple GPUs or CPUs in parallel (distributed configurations), which can significantly speed up training in presence of multiple GPUs (we won't use it in our example).\n* peft is a Python library by HuggingFace for efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs.\n* bitsandbytes by Tim Dettmers, is a lightweight wrapper around CUDA custom functions, in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and quantization functions. It allows to run models stored in 4-bit precision: while 4-bit bitsandbytes stores weights in 4-bits, the computation still happens in 16 or 32-bit and here any combination can be chosen (float16, bfloat16, float32, and so on).\n* transformers is a Python library for natural language processing (NLP). It provides a number of pre-trained models for NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and machine translation.\n* trl is a full stack library by HuggingFace providing a set of tools to train transformer language models with Reinforcement Learning, from the Supervised Fine-tuning step (SFT), Reward Modeling step (RM) to the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

We configures and initializes a Simple Fine-tuning Trainer (SFTTrainer) for training a large language model using the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, which should save time as it operates on a reduced number of parameters compared to the model's overall size. The PEFT method focuses on refining a limited set of (additional) model parameters, while keeping the majority of the pre-trained LLM parameters fixed. This significantly reduces both computational and storage expenses. Additionally, this strategy addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, which often occurs during the complete fine-tuning of LLMs.\n\nPEFTConfig:\n\nThe peft_config object specifies the parameters for PEFT. The following are some of the most important parameters:\n\n* lora_alpha: The learning rate for the LoRA update matrices.\n* lora_dropout: The dropout probability for the LoRA update matrices.\n* r: The rank of the LoRA update matrices.\n* bias: The type of bias to use. The possible values are none, additive, and learned.\n* task_type: The type of task that the model is being trained for. The possible values are CAUSAL_LM and MASKED_LM.\n\nTrainingArguments:\n\nThe training_arguments object specifies the parameters for training the model. The following are some of the most important parameters:\n\n* output_dir: The directory where the training logs and checkpoints will be saved.\n* num_train_epochs: The number of epochs to train the model for.\n* per_device_train_batch_size: The number of samples in each batch on each device.\n* gradient_accumulation_steps: The number of batches to accumulate gradients before updating the model parameters.\n* optim: The optimizer to use for training the model.\n* save_steps: The number of steps after which to save a checkpoint.\n* logging_steps: The number of steps after which to log the training metrics.\n* learning_rate: The learning rate for the optimizer.\n* weight_decay: The weight decay parameter for the optimizer.\n* fp16: Whether to use 16-bit floating-point precision.\n* bf16: Whether to use BFloat16 precision.\n* max_grad_norm: The maximum gradient norm.\n* max_steps: The maximum number of steps to train the model for.\n* warmup_ratio: The proportion of the training steps to use for warming up the learning rate.\n* group_by_length: Whether to group the training samples by length.\n* lr_scheduler_type: The type of learning rate scheduler to use.\n* report_to: The tools to report the training metrics to.\n* evaluation_strategy: The strategy for evaluating the model during training.\n\nSFTTrainer:\n\nThe SFTTrainer is a custom trainer class from the TRL library.
